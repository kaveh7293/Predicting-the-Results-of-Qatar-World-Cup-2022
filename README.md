# Predicting-the-Results-of-Qatar-World-Cup-2022
<h3> Problem Description </h3>
<p> In this study, I use the data from a previous data repository to predict the results of the Qatar soccer World Cup which will be in November. I focus on the modeling part in this study, as explantory data analysis were done in a previous repository. The data which have been used for this classification problem can be found <a href='https://github.com/kaveh7293/World-Cup-Results-Prediction--Accuracy-of-Common-Sense-/blob/main/final_results.xlsx'>here</a>. I will do the following steps in order to find the best possible model which can be used for predictions:<br>
  <ol>
    <li> Use a variety of feature selection techniques to determine the optimal features which need to be used for model prediction.</li>
    <li> Use a cross-validation to select among several models which can be used for classfication.</li>
    <li> Use a model for fitting and prediction of the results</li>
  </ol>
